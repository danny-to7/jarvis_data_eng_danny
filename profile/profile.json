I obtained my Bachelor of Science from University of Ontario Institute of Technology, and worked a brief internship with Tyco International. As a new graduate, software and data engineering seems like the perfect intersection of everything we were taught to appreciate - technical challenges that are best solved with an analytical approach. Of course, there is also the excitement of being able to work with emerging technologies in a thriving industry."
